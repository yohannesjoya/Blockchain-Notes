NOTE 1
# Blockchain
#### Explanation

A blockchain is an ever-growing list of data entries called blocks that are linked together to form an unchangeable chain using cryptography. Blockchains are typically managed by a permissionless peer-to-peer network. The participants of the network (nodes) store the data of the blockchain.Interactions that change the data in the blockchain are called transactions. They are sent to the peer-to-peer network and grouped into blocks of transactions. Special nodes in the network called miners, add new blocks of transactions to the blockchain and receive rewards in the native cryptocurrency for that.The most innovative part of blockchain technology is the consensus mechanism that decides how miners can add new data in the form of blocks of transactions to the blockchain. Bitcoin use a consensus mechanism called proof-of-work (POW). In POW miners need to spend computing power for the chance of being able to add a new block to the blockchain. Needing to spend energy on adding new data to the blockchain, prevents attackers from false entries because it is more profitable to add correct entries.The revolutionary innovation of blockchain technology is the ability to store data publicly in a permanent way, not being dependent on a central decision-maker that could change the data.

# Ethereum
#### Explanation

Ethereum is a decentralized blockchain-based computing infrastructure that executes programs called smart contracts and enables developers to create decentralized applications (dapps). Ethereum has a native cryptocurrency called Ether.

Bitcoin has a very limited scripting language and is not designed to be programmed for anything else than peer-to-peer money.

Ethereum's language is designed to execute arbitrary code and enable developers to create all kinds of applications on top of blockchain technology.

Ethereum is sometimes described as a world computer because it uses blockchain technology as a global data storage, that can store code and data, and execute programs on one globally distributed machine. This virtual computer, whose state all participants in the network share is called the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM).

Because the execution of programs and storing of data on Ethereum must be done by all the nodes in the network, performing computational tasks and making changes to the state of the data needs to be paid for to prevent abuse. Computational work is measured in Gas and is paid in Ether. Changes in the state are submitted via transactions.

The idea of Ethereum is to apply the benefits of blockchain technology to code and applications in general. Enabling developers to create applications with built-in economic functions that are transparent, immutable (unchangeable), and accessible.

But like Bitcoin, Ethereum struggles among other things with, energy efficiency, high transaction costs, and poor user experience.

# Celo

#### Explanation

Celo is a mobile-first blockchain that focuses on creating an accessible, environmentally friendly financial system. The Celo blockchain was developed in response to the many challenges that popular blockchains like Bitcoin and Ethereum are facing.Stable Value CurrenciesA crucial challenge for accessibility and large-scale adoption of cryptocurrencies as a medium of exchange is their price volatility. Celo provides a growing family of stablecoins like cUSD, cEUR, cREAL, USDC, with a stable value that can even be used to pay transaction fees.Proof-of-Stake Bitcoin is using the proof-of-work consensus mechanisms, which costs a lot of energy and leads to expensive and often slower transactions. Celo uses a proof-of-stake consensus algorithm that enables fast, affordable, and carbon-negative transactions.Phone Number MappingAnother barrier to the accessibility of cryptocurrencies is their poor user experience. Users need to generate a private/public key pair to receive a payment, and they need to know a user's address in order to send them a payment. Celo allows users to send cryptocurrencies just via phone numbers by mapping their phone numbers to public keys.Full EVM CompatibilityCelo is fully EVM compatible and lets developers write code in the popular Solidity smart contract language. This means that the Celo ecosystem can make use of Ethereum tooling, contracts, and token standards like ERC-20 or ERC721 (NFT).
